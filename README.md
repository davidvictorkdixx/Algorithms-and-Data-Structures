# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
Short course about algorithms and data structures in C programming language. Here, we have some classic algorithms.


All codes have a description in .pdf and test cases.

Use https://run.codes to compile code and run test cases. Some tasks have two versions: one iterative and one recursive.
